### Learnings from the project

 Bar plotting
Scatter plotting
Kernel Density plotting
Subplot operations
Axes modifications


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 first visualized the company's record with respect to loan approvals using bar graph.The company provides financial assistance across the different regions of the country. One interesting statistic that stakeholders want to see is the loan approval distribution across the regions.then drawn barbgraph of loan statusvs education satatus like graduate and not graduate.After seeing the loan status distribution, checked whether being graduate or not also leads to different loan amount distribution by plotting an overlapping density plot of two values.then saw correlation between 'ApplicantIncome' and 'LoanAmount' using scatter plot



### Challenges faced

 got difficulty in axes modification but that overcome with gogole search
